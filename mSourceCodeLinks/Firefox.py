# https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/<path>#<linenumber>
# On windows, all paths in the symbol files are lowercased. Unfortunately, both of these options do not accept paths
# with incorrect casing, but will give a 404. The only reasonable solution I've found is to search for the file using
# dxr.mozilla.org: this allows you to automatically redirect to the correct file. Unfortunately, I have not found a
# way to pass it a line number as well.
