TBD
==========
* `cBugId` can now be used as a JIT debugger.

Dumps
-----
* Make dump creation on-demand, rather than automatic:
  * Do not automatically make a dump based on `dxConfig["bSaveDump"]`
  * Add `cBugId.fSaveDumpToFile` to make a dump on demand.
  * Depricate `dxConfig` settings `bSaveDump`, `bOverwriteDump`, `sDumpFilePath` and `bFullDump`

Timeouts
--------
* Callbacks for timeouts added through `cCdbWrapper.foSetTimeout` now get the `cCdbWrapper` instance as an argument.
* Timeouts do not require a callback; they will simply break into the debugger without one.

General code cleanup
--------------------
* Use `cWithCallbacks` for event handling
* `cCdbWrapper.fAttachForProcessExecutableNames` -> `cCdbWrapper.fQueueAttachForProcessExecutableNames` for clarity
* `cCdbWrapper.fAttachForProcessId`-> `cCdbWrapper.fAttachCdbToProcessForId` for clarity
* `cCdbWrapper.fSelect[Process|Thread|ProcessAndThread]` -> `ProcessId` and `ThreadId` for clarity
* Comment out debug prints
* Improve handling of `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN` exceptions.
* Utility process is now a copy of `cdb.exe` that is started suspended. The cdb.exe process that will debug the target will attach to it on start up, unless BugId is used as a JIT debugger.
* Update external modules and adjust code where needed if external function names or arguments changed.
* Add `cFunction.sCdbId` for use in `cStack` to get a function's address.
  * Move `fnGetDebuggerTimeInSeconds` to its own file.

CDB I/O handling loop
---------------------
* Move a lot of the code in `cCdbWrapper.fCdbStdInOutHelperThread` into separate functions to cleanup the code.
  * Add `cCdbWrapper.fAllocateReserveMemoryIfNeeded` to simplify code that handles allocation of "reserve memory" in general.
  * Add `cCdbWrapper.fbHandleLastCdbEvent` to simplify code that handles the events that cause cdb.exe to pause execution of the application.
  * Add `cCdbWrapper.fHandleDebugOutputFromApplication` to handle debug output from application.
  * Add `cCdbWrapper.fHandleExceptionInUtilityProcess` to handle exceptions in the utility process.
  * Add `cCdbWrapper.fUpdateCdbISA` to select the cdb ISA for the current process.
* `cCdbWrapper.foStartApplicationProcess` now registers an event handler to resume the process after cdb has attached to them.
* `cCdbWrapper.fHandleNewApplicationProcess` -> `cCdbWrapper.fHandleAttachedToApplicationProcess` to handle cdb attaching to application processes.
* `cCdbWrapper.fHandleNewUtilityProcess` -> `cCdbWrapper.fHandleAttachedToUtilityProcess` to handle attaching to the utility processes.
* `cCdbWrapper.fHandleApplicationProcessTermination` -> `cCdbWrapper.fHandleCurrentApplicationProcessTermination`

2019-08-20
==========
This update have many internal improvements but has no functional changes other
than some minor bug fixes and improved bug translation.

Externally noticeable changes
-----------------------------
* Fix bug in reloading symbol files.
* Simplified and updated ntdll.dll heap bug translations.

Internal changes
----------------
* Use improved mWindowsAPI/mWindowsSDK modules.
* Use mWindowsSDK for many things previously provided by mWindowsAPI.
* Renamed variables to adhere to naming convention.
* Simplify Tests.cmd
* Added missing submodules to git.
* Added missing dependencies to dxProductDetails.json.

2019-03-04
==========
This update introduces new modules; you will need to download a new license
file to use it.

Externally noticeable changes
-----------------------------
+ Older version may fail to check for updates because a new version of
  `mProductDetails` requires changes to `dxProductsDetails.json` structure.
+ Handling of UWP Application has been improved to prevent errors for certain
  UWP applications.
+ `sDumpPath` config setting has been renamed `sDumpFilePath`.

Internal changes
----------------
+ `mFileSystem` module has been replaced with `mFileSytem2`

2018-11-21
==========
Externally noticeable changes
-----------------------------
+ Bug ids for Access Violation exceptions have been standardized to the
  following format: `<bug type id>:<memory details>[<size>][<offset>]`. This
  includes bug ids for guard page access exceptions, as
  `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exceptions are just a sub-type of
  `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`. bug type ids `W2RO` and `DEP` have been changed
  back to `AVW` and `AVE` to simplify things.
+ Text descriptions for Access Violation exceptions should now all follow the
  same format.
+ Determining if an Access Violations happened near the stack is now more
  precise by relying on the actual virtual allocation for the stack to
  determine what memory range is part of the stack.
+ Determining the integrity level of a process was throwing unpredictable
  exceptions. Since I do not care much about this information and have little
  time to fix it, I've opted to disable the code and not put the integrity
  level in the report anymore.

Internal changes
----------------
+ I've renamed more time related variables to include "InSeconds" in the name.
+ Test coverage has been improved by allowing you to trigger Access Violations
  in memory regions with specific properties (i.e. unallocated memory, reserved
  memory, inaccessible memory, and guard pages). Tests have been rebuild with
  VS 2017 and latest Win 10 SDK.

2018-11-07
==========
I have forgotten to update this file through a number of releases. Change
logs on GitHub will have to suffice as I unfortunately do not have the time
to retroactively describe all changes here.

Externally noticeable changes
-----------------------------
+ `mMultiThreading` and `mDebugOutput` modules have been added to dependencies.
+ All timeouts are now named `TimeoutInSeconds` to clarify the unit used. This
  includes those in `dxConfig.py`.

Internal changes since last release:
------------------------------------
+ `mWindowsAPI` has received quite a few changes to improve function and
  variable naming standardization. `cBugId` has had similar changes.
+ Timeout and application interruption implementation has been improved to make
  them more reliable and the simplify the code.

2018-06-05
==========
+ C++ bug translations, specifically OOM exceptions have been improved.
+ "STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE" exceptions are now reported as "InvalidHandle" in
  bug ids.

2018-06-02
==========
+ The way different threads are created and maintained in cBugId has been
  updated. This makes the code cleaner but most importantly, it appears to fix
  a bug where cBugId would hang after analysis was completed, and cdb.exe
  terminated. I suspected the root cause was calling `theading::Thread.join()`
  because it did not always return when a thread terminated. Since this was
  used by the cleanup thread to wait for the end of analysis when cdb.exe dies,
  it would explain the issue. I've replaced this code with code that waits for
  a `threading::Lock` that is released when the thread dies and it appears to
  have resolved the issue. It might point to a bug in Python, but I do not have
  time to try to prove this was the case - I'm just happen the bug is gone.

2018-06-01
==========
+ cdb.exe ISA (Instruction Set Architecture; x86 or x64) default is now based
  on the ISA of the Python version BugId is running in. It should ideally be
  set to the ISA of the processes it is going to be debugging. A warning event
  is fired when you try to debug an x86 process in x64 cdb.exe as page heap
  information will be hard or impossible to collect in that case.
+ When !heap does not return data, the code will attempt to find page heap
  information by reading page heap structures from the virtual memory in which
  the heap block is stored. This will not work for freed blocks where the
  virtual memory is already deallocated.
+ Submodule load order is now fixed for better error handling.
+ Minor improvements not worth mentioning.

2018-05-30
==========
Unfortunately, I have not had time to write release notes for all the changes
I committed the past months. I am reconstructing these from commit logs so
there may be a few missing from the below list:

Changes that affect how cBugId is integrated into other projects
----------------------------------------------------------------
* CPU usage is now on demand; please call cBugId.fCheckForExcessiveCPUUsage()
  to check for excessive CPU usage at any time while the application is
  suspended. You can use cBugId.foSetTimeout to start excessive CPU usage
  checks when the application has not responded for a certain amount of time.
- Note that CPU usage detection can still result in random crashes in the
  application for unknown reasons. This is assumed to be a hard-to-analyze
  bug in how cdb handles breakpoints.

Changes that affect bug ids
---------------------------
* Assertion failures reported through STATUS_ASSERTION_FAILURE exceptions are
  now passed to the application first, as they are not considered fatal by
  default and the application may be able to handle them.
* Bug translations have been improved; the bug id now better reflects the root
  cause of the issue for a number of crashes in a number of applications.
* When cdb terminates unexpectedly, the bug id, description and security impact
  are now based on the exit code if it is a Windows status or error code.

Changes that affect reports
---------------------------
* Registers shown in report have been improved.
* Disassembly shown in reports has been improved.

Internal changes
----------------
* Code has been updated to reduce reliability on cdb.exe as this is know to
  be unreliable every now and then.
* Breakpoints are now really removed when requested, rather than replaced with
  a nop.
* Various bug fixes that resulted in code functioning as expected where older
  code would not work as expected for some reason.
* Various output and comments have been improved to remove spelling errors or
  clarify complex situations.
* Various asserts  have been added to collect information about potential
  issues so they can be addressed when they are encountered.
* Various code has been rewritten to optimize it and/or improve reliability.
* Memory allocations created to check for OOM conditions are now freed to
  prevent a memory leak.
* Removed dead code.

2018-02-23
==========
cBugId and all its modules require a license to use. There is a 30 day trial
period during which you can test BugId without a license. After the trial
period you will need to get a license to continue to use it.

Licenses for non-commercial use are available for free, while licenses for
commercial use can be purchased from the author. For more details, and to
acquire a license, please visit https://bugid.skylined.nl.

As usual, various minor bugs have been addressed and small improvements have
been made in many places, but only the important ones are mentioned here. You
should check the commit logs if you want to know all the details.

Changes that affect bug ids
---------------------------
* Iso bug translations have been improved.
* SafeInt bug translations have been added.
* The class name for C++ exceptions is now extracted from the exception
  information, rather than guessed using the object's vftable.
* A stack exhaustion caused by a lack of available memory is now reported as
  an out-of-memory (OOM) bug.
* An ASan out-of-memory debug message is now reported as an out-of-memory (OOM)
  bug.
* A breakpoint exceptions in a malloc() call is now reported as an
  out-of-memory (OOM) bug.
* CPUUsage worm run-time has been increased again, as I found the shorter
  period provided even worse results than the original.

Changes to collateral
---------------------
* More instructions are handled to allow more crashes to be ignored in order
  to determine collateral damage.

Changes to events
-----------------
* The "Event" event has been removed.
* The "License errors" event has been added. This event is fired when the
  system does not have a valid license for cBugId or one of its dependencies.
  Its argument is an array of error message.
* The "License warnings" event has been added. This event is fired when the
  system is in its trial period for cBugId or one of its dependencies, or if
  one of the licenses is about to expire.

Changes to console output
-------------------------
* The stdio pipes for application processes are no longer closed by BugId when
  the process is terminated. There should not be any need to close these pipes,
  but doing so could sometimes prevent BugId from showing the last lines of
  output from the application if they were buffered. 

Changes to tests
----------------
+ A new "OOM Stack" test will trigger a stack exhaustion by allocating all
  available memory before attempting to grow the stack.
+ Various SafeInt tests will trigger SafeInt exceptions.
+ List of loaded root modules has been updated to Python 2.7.14.

2018-01-30
==========
There have been many major changes, and even more smaller ones. For brevity,
I'll only list those that are most likely to impact you.

Changes that affect bug ids
---------------------------
* Use-After-Free bugs are now reported as `[RWE]AF` instead of `UAF[RWE]`.
* `IncorrectHeap` bugs are now reported as `WrongHeap`.
* Heap corruption that has been detect by checking page heap structures is now
  reported at the end of the bug id between curly brackets. If this heap
  corruption covers was reported with a VERIFIER STOP, this information covers
  the start offset, so the start offset is not added to the bug id after the
  heap block size as it would normally be. For instance, a one byte write at an
  address two bytes past the end of a three byte buffer would be reported as
  `OOBW[3]{+2~1}`, and a one byte write at an address two bytes before the
  start of a three byte buffer would be reported as `OOBW[3]{-2~1}`.
* Linear sequential buffer overflows in buffers that are not size-aligned and
  thus overwrite the page heap block suffix are now detected as such when they
  trigger a VERIFIER STOP or cause an AV. These are reported with bug ids that
  start with `BOF` instead of `OOBW`. For instance, a one byte write past a
  two bytes buffer would be reported as `BOF[2]{+0~1}`. For larger buffers and
  overflows that cause an AV, rather than only page heap suffix corruption, the
  bug ids will include the offset where the AV happened. For instance, writing
  18 bytes into an 13 byte buffer would be reported as `BOF[13]+3{0~3}`:
  The buffer overflow was detected at offset `+3` past the end of the buffer,
  and had already corrupted `3` bytes starting at offset `0` from the end of
  the buffer at that point. With collateral enabled, the next bug reported will
  be `OOBW[13]+4{0~3}`, as the suffix corruption is still detected, but the AV
  no longer happens at the address immediately after this corruption, so this
  is not detected as a linear buffer overflow.
* Bug ids for nearly linear overflows where some bytes are skipped could have
  been incorrectly assumed to be normal linear overflows which would have
  resulted in slightly incorrect BugIds. e.g. if the application overwrites 3
  bytes past the end of a buffer without writing beyond the end of the page
  heap page, then skip one byte and writes at offset 4 from the end to cause an
  access violation, the bug id reported would have been `[size]0~3` instead of
  `[size]+4`. While the former is not technically incorrect, for the new
  collateral feature it makes more sense to report the corruption related to
  the access violation, so subsequent collateral bugs have different bug ids
* Improved bug translations may result in different (but more accurate) bug ids
  for various bugs.
* A workaround for a cdb stack unwinding bug should provide a better stack and
  subsequent better stack hashes.

Changes to bug reporting
------------------------
* ASan bug detection has been rewritten to work with the latest version of
  BugId and Chromium ASan builds.
* Added `dxConfig["bIgnoreAccessViolations"]`. When set to `true`, all access
  violation exceptions are ignored. This is needed with Chromium ASan builds,
  which trigger a lot of AVs on purpose (apparently by design).
* Added `dxConfig["bReportBugsForOOMException"]`. When set to `true`, all first-
  chance OOM exceptions BugId detects trigger a bug report. When set to `false`,
  only second-chance OOM exceptions can trigger a bug report; the application
  is allowed to attempt to handle them internally first.
* Added a new type of bug report for "Cdb could not be terminated".
* VERIFIER STOP messages are now detected using an "Application debug output"
  event handler implemented in `cVerifierStopDetector`.

Changes to collateral
---------------------
* Access Violations using invalid pointers will now also be handled by
  "collateral". I found that values poisoned by collateral can sometimes be
  used as indexes and that this resulted in address of the form
      `uValidArrayStartAddress` + `uPoisonedIndex` * `uArrayElementSize`
  If `uPoisonedIndex` is of a large enough type (32bit integer) on x64, this
  will commonly result in attempts to access memory at invalid addresses.

Changes to HTML bug reports
---------------------------
* Windows Run Time exceptions are no longer logged in HTML reports, as I
  never used that info and I don't expect anyone else to need it.
* "Ignored first chance event" output generated by cdb is removed from
  application debug output.
* Debug output generated by page heap is removed from application debug
  output.
* The total amount of memory used by the application has been added to the
  report.

Changes to events
-----------------
* Application debug output is now detected and "Application debug output"
  events are fired.
* "Started process" event has been renamed to "Process started".
* "Attached to process" event has been renamed "Process attached".
* Relevant event callbacks now get either a `mWindowsAPI.cConsoleProcess` or a
  `mWindowsAPI.cProcess` instance as their first argument instead of the
  process id, binary name and command-line. Note that `cConsoleProcess` is a
  sub-class of `cProcess`. They also always get a `bIsMainProcess` as their
  second argument, even for events that are only ever fired for main processes.
* "Application debug output" events now get a `cProcess` instance as argument.
* Log messages are now added to the HTML report using a "Log message" event
  handler.
* More log messages have been added for various events.
* Callbacks for the "event" event can now be added, which are called whenever
  another event is fired with a variable number of argument: (`oBugId`,
  `sEventName`, *`axEventArguments`), where `axEventArguments` depends on the
  event that fired.

Bug fixes
---------
* Python `threading.Event.wait` is not reliable, which could cause a call to
  `cBugId.fWait` to hang after BugId is finished. I am now using
  `threading.Lock` objects which appears to not have this issue.
* Module importing has been improved to prevent leaking internal modules to the
  global namespace.
* Bug translations to `None` will now correctly prevent reporting of a bug.
* More cdb installation paths were added.
* `oVersionInformation` now handles failed connections.
* A few (full) tests were fixed as they had incorrect bug ids.
* Source file information without line number information is now handled
  correctly.
* Breakpoints can only be set in allocated, executable memory.

Code cleanup
------------
* All Access Violation handle code has been moved to an `mAccessViolation`
  sub-module.
* More code uses `mWindowsAPI` to gather information directly, rather than
  ask cdb and parse it's output. This means a lot of old helper functions were
  removed. It should also make this code more reliable and easier to maintain.
* The way the cdb command line is constructed has been changed to make the code
  easier to read.
* Main processes are now tracked by uid, and marked as such as soon as
  we know their id (which may be before cdb has attached to them).
* Cdb and Application processes are now started as `mWindowsAPI.cConsoleProcess`
  This allows more control over the processes. cdb now attaches to the new
  application processes, instead of starting them.
* cdb.exe should now be cleanly terminated with a "q" command in all but a very
  few situations.
* `cBugId.fStop` (and `cCdbWrapper.fStop`) now interrupt the application
  to terminate cdb using a "q" command. Note that `cCdbWrapper.fStop` does
  not wait for cdb to terminate but returns immediately.
* Many `cCdbWrapper` methods have been moved to separate files.
* Removed `rImportantStd*Lines`: I did not use this, so they were removed to
  reduce code complexity.
* Removed `aoInternalExceptions` and `cCdbWrapper.bFatalBugDetected`: `cBugId`
  uses events to report exceptions, you should track them yourselves if you
  need to.
* Removed `cCdbWrapper.fuGetVariableId` and `cCdbWrapper.fReleaseVariableId`
  as the were not used.
* Removed `cCdbWrapper.duAddress_by_uBreakpointId` as it was not used.
* `cCdbWrapper.fuAddBreakpoint` has been renamed to
  `fuAddBreakpointForAddress` and `cCdbWrapper.fuAddBreakpointForSymbol`
  has been added.
* Initial breakpoints for new application processes can now be ignored, since
  cdb no longer starts the application processes. This should remove any chance
  of mistaking these for an application initiated breakpoint.

Changes to tests
----------------
* Logging for tests has been expanded.
* Excessive CPU usage checks are disabled for all checks that are not expected
  to trigger them, which speeds up testing a little.
* A test for `WrongHeap` bug ids has been created and added to the tests.
* Test binaries have been rebuild.

2017-12-21
==========
New features
------------
+ `bIgnoreFirstChanceNULLPointerAccessViolations` in `dxConfig.py` allows you
  to tell cBugId to ignore all first-chance NULL pointer access violations.
  This is useful when you are debugging an application that triggers NULL
  pointers on purpose, and handles them correctly, but does not have debug
  symbols. Lack of debug symbols prevents you from creating a bug translation
  to ignore these exceptions, but this setting can allow you to do so without
  also ignoring unhandled NULL pointers.

2017-12-18
==========
New or changed features
-----------------------
+ Callback functions are no longer provided as arguments to the constructor,
  but can be registered by calling the `fAddCallback` of a `cBugId`
  instance. This means you can add more than one function for a specific event.
  A list of possible events you can add callbacks for can be found in 
  `cCdbWrapper.py`, specifically `cCdbWrapper.dafEventCallbacks_by_sEventName`
  is a dict that is used to map event names to a list of event callback
  functions.
+ New processes are started using Windows API calls directly, rather than by
  using cdb commands. This allows cBugId to distinguish between cdb and
  application stdout/sterr output reliably. It reduces the chances of
  misinterpreting cdb output.
+ cBugId constructor has a new argument `uMaximumNumberOfBugs`. Providing a
  value larger than 1 turns on "collateral" bug handling: certain access
  violation bugs are reported, but rather than terminating the application,
  cBugId will attempt to "fake" that the instruction that caused this exception
  succeeded, providing a tainted value (0x41414141...) as the read result if
  applicable. This may be useful in proving that a particular vulnerability is
  theoretically exploitable or not, as the effect of control over the data that
  would have been read or written becomes more clear.
  To implement this feature in 32-bit processes, a memory region is reserved in
  every such process at 0x41410000-0x41420000, to prevent the tainted value
  from pointing to valid memory.
+ Access violation handling has been completely overhauled to make it more
  structured and allow "collateral" bug handling.
+ `uMaxMemoryDumpSize` was increased from 0x400 to 0x1000

BugId changes
-------------
+ Improved bug translations for various things.

Internal changes
----------------
+ Internal objects are hidden in cBugReport instances.
+ Updates of mWindowsAPI let to some changes in the code.
+ Use of events has cleaned up the code used to make the callbacks everywhere.
+ Cleanup code was improved.
+ List module cdb output processing was improved.
+ Tests have been improved.
+ Tests results are no longer stored in github.

2017-11-29
==========
BugId changes
-------------
+ Improved `wil` bug translations

Internal changes
----------------
+ Reworked threading system to track all threads so we can find any threads
  do not terminate as expected.
+ Tests now always write HTML report when requested.
+ Module symbols are loaded "noisy" for debugging failures to load them.
+ `mWindowsAPI` is used for getting values for exception code defines.
+ `mWindowsDefines` has been modified into `cWindowsStatusOrError`; this offers
  slight improved naming for clarity. It also no longer exports any exception
  code defines, as `mWindowsAPI` is now used for these. All calls to
  `mWindowsDefines.doWindowsDefines_by_uValue.get` have been replaced by calls
  to `cWindowsStatusOrError.foGetForCode()`.

2017-11-24
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Processes are started directly by cBugId through Windows API calls, rather
  than by cdb.exe through the `.create` command. The later did not handle
  spaces in paths, which broke cBugId for certain applications. This also
  allows cBugId to redirect stdin, stdout and stderr and separate it from
  cdb.exe stdin, stdout and stderr. AFAIK this should remove any chance of the
  application reading the commands cBugId sends to cdb.exe as its input and
  prevents the application's output mixing with cdb.exe output. This has
  several benefits:
  - Parsing cdb.exe output is more reliable, as the application output can no
    longer get mixed in.
  - Recording application output reliably is now possible.
  - The application can read from stdin, allowing cBugId to work on console
    applications while you interact with them. E.g. you can run
    `BugId.py %ComSpec%`, type commands and see cmd.exe output the results.
+ More/better bug translations
+ Better synchronisation of cdb termination. I am not sure if this used to
  cause any problems, but recent changes caused deadlocks, which revealed that
  cdb may not be terminated when the code assumes it is. This has been resolved
  and cdb should now always be terminated before the stdin/stdout thread dies.

New features
------------
+ Added optional `fLogMessageCallback` argument. Value should be a function,
  which gets called whenever there is something worth logging. The arguments
  passed to this function are `oBugId`, `sMessageClass`, and `sMessage`.
+ Added optional `fApplicationStdOutOrErrOutputCallback` argument. Value should
  be a function, which gets called the application outputs anything to stdout
  or stderr. The arguments passed to this function are `oBugId`, `uProcessId`,
  `sBinaryName`, `sCommandLine`, `sStdOutOrErr`, and `sMessage`.

2017-11-21
==========
New features
------------
+ Added optional `uProcessMaxMemoryUse` and `uTotalMaxMemoryUse` arguments to
  `cBugId` constructor, which can be used to try to limit the amount of memory
  each process of the application or the all processes of the application
  combined can allocate, respectively. The values are the maximum amounts in
  bytes. This feature is implemented using Job Objects. Since no process can be
  added to more than one Job Object, cBugId will not be able to apply this
  limit if a process is already added to a Job Object. Also, if the application
  attempts to add a process to a Job Object after cBugId has applied the memory
  limits, this will fail. I am not currently aware of any application that
  tries to add any of its processes to a Job object after cBugId does, but
  please do report if this breaks any application. Note that if you specify
  `None` for both values, no Job Object is created and no processes are added
  to a Job Object by cBugId.
+ Added optional `fFailedToApplyMemoryLimitsCallback` argument to `cBugId`
  constructor, which takes a function that will be called if the
  `uProcessMaxMemoryUse` and/or `uTotalMaxMemoryUse` memory limits cannot be
  applied. The arguments passed to this callback function are `oBugId`,
  `uProcessId`, `sProcessBinaryName`, and `sProcessCommandLine`.

Changes to BugIds
----------------
+ `oBugReport.sBugLocation` and stack hashes will now use the lowercase name of
  the process' binary, to prevent different values being returned if the case
  of the binary name changes.

Improvements
------------
+ The `uReserveRAM` setting in dxConfig has been replaced with the
  `uReservedMemory` setting. It is still used to reserve some memory, to be
  released when an exception needs to be analyzed in order to allow BugId to
  operate under low-memory situations. The allocation should now be more
  robust, and this feature should be more reliable.
+ A "utility" process is started in the debugger before it attaches to or
  starts the target application. cBugId will trigger a breakpoint in this
  utility process whenever it needs to interrupt cdb.exe. This allows it to
  reliably determine if any breakpoint was triggered by cBugId itself or by the
  target application: the former breakpoints will always happen in the utility
  process while the later never will. This utility process does away with the
  need for a separate "UWP dummy" process, as it can perform that role as well.
  Furthermore, it makes it easier to reliably detect when cdb.exe cannot start
  an application given a command-line because the specified binary cannot be
  found.
+ Improved and added bug translations.
+ Process information including the binary name and path, command line, ISA,
  and pointer size is determined through direct Windows API calls. This is less
  error prone than the old code which parsing the output of cdb commands for
  this information.

Cosmetic Changes
----------------
+ Renamed `cBugId` constructor's `sApplicationPackageName` and `sApplicationId`
  arguments to `sUWPApplicationPackageName` and `sUWPApplicationId`
  respectively.

Bug fixes
---------
+ The path to cdb.exe and the path to the symbols will now be quoted in the cdb
  command line to prevent confusion in cases where either path contains spaces.
+ Added code to handle a weird, contradictory VERIFIER STOP error so I can
  hopefully get more information about it.
+ Fix bug where a memory dump was attempted on memory that had been freed,
  which could potentially lead to an exception.


2017-11-01
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Heap information and corruption detection has been rewritten to allow the
  code to gather more information by directly finding and parsing page heap
  structures in the target process. This has a large benefit in that it allows
  me to get more information than cdb can provide and make sure the information
  is correct. Also, I no longer need to work around some issues in cdb and
  should be able to implement this for other memory managers more easily (e.g.
  ASan).
+ The new page heap information and corruption detection should remove many, if
  not all, cases where the exact size of a heap block cannot be determined. The
  upshot is you should see less bug ids containing `[?]` (e.g. `UAF[?]-0x10`).
  This does mean some bug ids will change.
+ These changes have not been tested with an ASan build yet, so that may be
  completely broken at the moment. I apologize for this inconvenience; as soon
  as I use an ASan build of an application, I will make sure to check that this
  works, an hopefully improve that too.
+ If you use the `uArchitectureIndependentBugIdBits` setting in `dxConfig.py`,
  corruption hashes will not longer be added to the bug id. This is because the
  size of detectable corruption can differ between 32-bit and 64-bit and thus
  the corruption hash would too, defeating the entire goal of using this
  setting to get architecture independent bug ids.
+ mWindowsRegistry has been absorbed into mWindowsAPI.

2017-10-25
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Process binary name is now lower-cased again. It was accidentally changed to
  use whatever casing the file-system used recently. This made it harder to
  match the the bug location id to previous location ids without having to
  do a case-insensitive match. You can now do a case-sensitive match again.

2017-10-23
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Windows Registry access is now done through the mWindowsRegistry sub-module.

2017-10-12
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Improve the way dangling processes are terminated in the cleanup thread.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Fixed missing property that would cause exceptions.

2017-10-10
==========
Improvements
------------
+ All Windows API calls are not done through the mWindowsAPI sub-module.
+ Removed dependency on Kill sub-module by replacing calls to its code with
  functions that use the mWindowsAPI sub-module to achieve the same. This
  removes the need to call an executable to terminate a process, which should
  speed things up.
+ mWindowsAPI sub-module calls are now used to enumerate running processes and
  their executable names. This removes the need to parse cdb output to
  enumerate all processes that run a particular executable, which should 
  improve stability. It also makes determining the executable name for a
  process more reliable.
+ The FileSystem sub-module is now called mFileSystem.

2017-10-06
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fixed two bugs introduced by yesterdays changes

2017-10-05
==========
Changed default settings
------------------------
+ The default number of instructions shown in a disassembly before and after a
  relevant instruction has been increased from 0x20 to 0x40 and from 0x10 to
  0x20 respectively. This should make it easier to do a little reverse
  engineering using the report and should not have much performance impact, as
  getting a few extra instructions should not take too much time. This should
  not have an impact on anything else.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Fixed an uninitialized variable exception in `!heap` output parsing.

Code Improvements
-----------------
+ Delete old code
+ Fix incorrectly named variables
+ Rename cPageHeapAllocation to cHeapAllocation.
+ Improve cHeapAllocation code.
+ Replaced some function calls that took a cProcess instance as an argument
  with methods calls on the cProcess instance.

2017-09-22
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Added more exception code details.
+ Added more Chrome OOM bug translations.
+ Added error code to assertion error when VitualAllocateEx fails in order to
  find the root cause of https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId/issues/40.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix bug where Chrome paths could get a double slash in their path.
+ Fix module list output parsing bug.

2017-09-18
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Timeout callbacks now always get call with the cBugId instance as their first
  argument. Any additional arguments are added after that. This brings the
  callback in line with all other callbacks, which already got the cBugId
  instance in their first argument.
+ `sReportHTML` is always set (to None if not requested). This makes it easier
  for anyone using cBugId to check if there is a HTML report. (Attempts to
  read this property would result in an exception before it no report was
  generated, as the property would never get set).
+ Ignoring C++ exceptions is now implemented at run-time. This means you can
  modify the `bIgnoreCPPExceptions` setting `dxConfig.py` after loading the
  `cBugId` module. In earlier versions, modifying this setting after loading
  the module would not change the behavior.
+ Ignoring WinRT exceptions is now also possible using the
  `bIgnoreWinRTExceptions` setting in `dxConfig.py`. It works similar to
  `bIgnoreCPPExceptions` and should also speed up debugging of applications
  that use these exceptions frequently, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and
  Edge.
+ Improved bug translations.
+ Added more error codes and their descriptions, specifically for XAML and
  WinRT.
+ Failure to debug the target is now handled better.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Certain stack traces errors reported by cdb were not handled correctly. This
  should now be fixed.

2017-08-30
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Directly access the registry to ensure page heap is enabled for every process
  as this is much faster than asking cdb, which speeds up cBugId significantly.
+ Always ensure page heap is enabled for a process if no page heap information
  is available for an address in memory. This means the
  `fPageHeapNotEnabledCallback` can now be called even if
  `dxConfig["bEnsurePageHeap"]` is disabled. If you do not have a handler for
  this event, an exception will be raised. If you want to ignore missing page
  heap, you need to add a (dummy) handler to prevent this exception.
+ If page heap is not enabled for a binary, this is now cached as well, which
  should improve performance.
+ If symbol loading fails, try to force downloading the pdb from a symbol
  server and overwrite the local cache. If this also fails, stop trying to load
  the symbols.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Removed excess <br/>-s from HTML report.
+ Fixed use of the wrong variable names in page heap checks that could have
  caused an unwanted exception.

2017-08-25
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId/issues/38. This requires limiting the
  maximum number of bytes in an allocation that cBugId tries to extract from a
  process in one go. This limit is defined by `dxConfig["uMaxMemoryDumpSize"]`.
+ Fix https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId/issues/39
+ Add more option for memory dumps (https://github.com/SkyLined/cBugId/pull/8).
  You can now specify a path where you want the dumps to be saved in
  `dxConfig["sDumpPath"]` (`None` -> current directory, which is the same as
  before this change) and the type of dump you want in `dxConfig["bFullDump"]`
  (`True` -> full dump, `False` -> mini dump, the same as before this change).

2017-08-22
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Replaced several files that were used for exception codes (NTSTATUS, HRESULT)
  and information about their id, description, and severity with one file that
  covers all Windows header file #defines I currently know of.
+ Added bug translations and source links
+ Add application run time to debug output when running CPU Usage worm. This
  should help you determine progress.
+ Reduced default CPU Usage worm runtime to 1 second; this should be ample time
  in most cases in my experience.
+ The tests have been rewritten to simplify them; they were needlessly complex
  because they used to be run in parallel. Now that they are not run in
  parallel any more, I was able to remove a lot of crap.

Bug fixes
---------
+ When failing to debug the application, cBugId.oBugReport is now set to None.
  it was not set at all, which could lead to an exception if you tried to read
  it.
+ When processing internal errors, do not try to handle HTML report data unless
  the user requested a HTML report. The previous code would cause an exception
  if the user did not want a HTML report, as it attempted to read a property
  that was never set.

2017-08-17
==========
A lot has been changed, but I was too busy to keep track of everything and
release periodic updates. Unfortunately, this means that the below list may not
be complete and that you may need to make a few changes to your code if you use
cBugId directly.

Bug fixes
---------
+ When getting disassembly, part or all of the area we would like to disassemble
  might be in memory that cannot be read. In this case, we'll try to shrink the
  area until we are successful, or find we cannot disassemble anything.
+ Fix stack hashes for recursive calls. At least, I hope. At some point I
  decided to drop inlined functions from the stack hash for recursive function
  calls, assuming that they did not add useful information. However, functions
  may or may not be inlined by a compiler to optimize the code, and different
  builds of the same code could therefore get a different BugId for the same
  crash. To prevent this, I'm no longer ignoring inlined functions in the stack
  hashes of recursive calls. I've modified the code that combines hashes to
  reduce their number to the requested number as well, as I was not sure that
  code worked correctly. The HTML report now also contains all the hashes of all
  stack frames in the loop, so debugging this issue should be easier, if it
  still exists. *Note that these changes may result in different BugIds for the
  same recursive function call bug for different versions of BugId.*
+ Attempt to fix the logging in HTML reports. Adding useful cdb output to HTML
  reports has been neglected for some time, and bugs have snug in that make the
  output less than complete or useful. I may decide to remove the fine-tuning
  features to make it either fully on or off in the near future, in order to
  simplify things.
+ Attempt to address an issue where a command-line utility being debugged that
  is attempting to read from stdin may actually read a command send by cBugId
  that was intended for cdb.exe. This is done by sending a dummy command, which
  may or may not get "eaten" by the target application before sending commands
  to cdb.exe (the application is supposed to be suspended, so won't "eat" more
  than one line of input).
+ Fix errors when reporting internal errors, which were caused by changes made
  to the bug report HTML template and a missing import; the code has been
  updated to work with the new template.
+ Limit the size of memory dumps created when ASan reports an error and for
  STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN exceptions to prevent assertion failures in code
  that checks the size is limited.
+ Handle ambiguous symbol errors when getting a symbol's address.
+ More commands are repeated if cdb gives a temporary error.

Improvements
------------
+ Many methods that were process-specific were moved to the cProcess class in
  order to prevent accidentally executing them on the wrong process.
+ Missing end-of-command-markers are handled by throwing a specific exception
  that can be caught to handle them.
+ Stale and superfluous code has been removed.
+ Add complete list of stack hashes to HTML report for recursive calls with
  large loops.
+ Timeout handle code was rewritten to be more robust and reliable. The code
  now uses a cTimeout object to represent a timeout, and `fxSetTimeout` has
  been renamed to `foSetTimeout` and returns a cTimeout instance.

2017-07-17
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ When getting a "better" function symbol from a call instruction, any offset
  was not detected if it was more than 15 (i.e. at least two hex digits). This
  could lead to incorrect symbols being used. This change will modify the BugId
  of some issues where this issue was previously triggered, but it should
  make the results more accurate and helpful. 

Improvements
------------
+ Better bug translations for Asan, Chrome, and v8.
+ Change default number of stack frames to 100 (from 40) because I ran into
  some cases where there were over 40 irrelevant functions on the stack, so
  BugId was unable to determine the function in which the actual problem was.
  (Background: ASan appears to use a recursive function call to do something
  while reporting errors, which results in many ASan related functions on the
  stack, which should be ignored).

2017-07-11
==========
Changes to dxConfig and cBugId arguments.
-----------------------------------------
- Removed all console output from everywhere; cBugId is an engine to be used by
  some other project, and therefore not supposed to output anything to the
  console at any time; the project that uses it should output whatever
  information it may want to present to the user. All `bOutput*` settings in
  `dxConfig.py` have been removed and replaced by `fStdInInputCallback` and
  `fStdOutOutputCallback`, similar to how stderr output was already being
  handled.

2017-07-10
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Better bug translations for Chrome, CPP, NTDLL and v8.
+ Better source links for Chrome.
+ CDB command comments are now back in the HTML report (they were accidentally
  remove in a previous code change).

2017-07-04
==========
Improvements
------------
+ The debugger extension has been removed in favor of direct Windows API calls
  to modify memory protection in a debugged process.
+ The bug reports now include the integrity level of the process in which the
  bug was found and reports if it is not sandboxed (i.e. medium integrity or
  higher).

2017-07-03
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Had to add a space to UWP commands send to cdb to prevent the command-
  terminating semicolon from being mistaken to be part of the application id or
  argument.
+ Handle cases where page heap prove little to no info better (i.e. don't
  trigger uninitialize variable exceptions).
+ Fix limiting of memory dump sizes: I think there was an off-by-one-pointer
  bug in the original code that would be caught later by an assert. This should
  now be fixed and the size should be limited correctly. I've added tests to
  check for this.

Improvements
------------
+ More module commands can now be retried if cdb truncates their output.

2017-06-30
==========
Changes to BugIds
-----------------
+ Inline functions are now (again) part of the bug id location hash. I found
  that with different builds, some functions may or may not be inlined and this
  was causing the bugid location hash to be different for the same issue.

Changes to dxConfig
-------------------
+ The `uMaxMemoryDumpSize` setting in `dxConfig` is in *bytes* not *pointer*.
+ The `uStackDumpSize` setting in `dxConfig` has been renamed to
  `uStackDumpSizeInPointers` to better explain its size unit.

Improvements
------------
+ Bug translations have been improved for various components.
+ Console background color is preserved.
+ Usage text highlighting is consistent.
+ Warn the user about potentially needing to cBugId with administrator rights
  when cdb cannot attach to a process and the error indicates this may be the
  cause.

Bug fixes
---------
+ The `uMaxMemoryDumpSize` setting in `dxConfig` is applied correctly.
+ When dumping a page heap allocation for a VERIFIER STOP, the address of the
  heap block is only used when it is actually known.

2017-06-26
==========
Notes
-----
+ Start of ASan integration: this update includes bug translations for ASan
  that should give you much better stack ids and help you track down the
  function in which the issue is, not the ASan function that reported the issue.
  This is part of an ongoing effort to integrate ASan into BugId.
+ Improvements made in this update may change the bug id of some crashes.
  Hopefully these changes will be improvements, in that they better identify
  the type of issue and location in the code. Let me know if this is not the
  case.

Improvements
------------
+ Bug translations have been improved for ASan, Chrome, Edge, and V8.
+ Source code links have been added for Chrome ASan builds.
+ If the stack frame symbol and call instruction symbol agree on the function,
  the stack frame is now used, because it has offset information.
+ If the call instruction symbol has an offset, it is ignored. A call is
  is expected to always be to the first instruction of a function, so if there
  is any offset, the symbol is assumed to tbe incorrect.
+ Modules are now cached better, which should prevent a lot of superfluous cdb
  commands being executed and speed up analysis.

BugFixes
--------
+ Fixed uninitialized variables and properties in cUWPApplication.py
+ Better parsing of !teb output to work around some errors.

2017-06-21
==========
New features
------------
+ Support for UWP apps (Universal Windows Platform apps, a.k.a. PLM apps,
  Metro-style apps, store apps, and probably half a dozen other names).
  You can run a UWP app by providing an `sApplicationPackageName` and an
  `sApplicationId` argument to `cBugId`, rather than process ids to attach to
  or a binary path to start. Note that this may not include some brokers used
  by sandboxed UWP apps; you may have to find a way to automatically debug
  those as well using `fAttachToProcessesForBinaryName`, as explained next.
+ `fAttachToProcessesForBinaryName` and `fAttachToProcessesForBinaryNames`
  allow you to debug all processes that are running a given binary. At this
  point you can only use it after starting cBugId, i.e. when you are already
  debugging something else. (This was added as a hack to debug broker processes
  of Microsoft Edge, which are created after Microsoft Edge starts).

2017-06-19
==========
New features
------------
+ Initial support for debugging PLM apps (Process Lifecycle Management). This
  is a bit hacky, may not include some processes that you might expect to get
  debugged (e.g. brokers processes in Edge) and may be subject to a complete
  overhaul in the near future, but I just wanted to give you a chance to play
  with it as well as have the public source the same as what I use myself, as
  this significantly simplifies fixing bug reports and commits.
  Note that there currently are not tests for this.

Changes to report
-----------------
+ Only second chance WRT originate errors are now handled to improve
  performance. This means information from first chance WRT originate errors
  is not longer collected and stored in the report.

Changes to dxConfig
-------------------
+ `bOutputStdErr` has been removed. If you want to see stderr output, please
  provide a callback handler for `fStdErrOutputCallback` and print the output
  yourself. Expect `bOutputStdIO` to be replaced by callbacks at some point as
  well.
+ `bOutputCommandLine` has been removed. If you want to see the cdb command-
  line, please provide a callback handler for `fApplicationRunningCallback` and
  print the cBugId.sCdbCommandLine argument. Not that cdb may not get started
  immediately, e.g. when debugging a PLM app, which is why you have to wait for
  this event.

Changes to tests
----------------
+ Make them more user friendly by attempting to detect PYTHON before blindly
  trying to use it and report an error if it cannot be detected.
+ Add "--quick" argument to run a minimal set of tests (nop and int3). This
  basically loads everything to check there are no syntax errors, and checks if
  a debug breakpoint can be detected, but nothing else. There may still be
  logic bugs in the code that went undetected after these tests. I use them
  when I fix something as simple as a typo and want to quickly check if I
  didn't fat-finger it, but don't need to run the normal or full test suit to
  test everything still works.

Improvements
------------
+ Better bug translations in many cases.
+ Event callback handling should now be more efficient when they are not
  provided.
+ Added more sanity checks
+ Allow more cdb commands to be retried if they fail for unknown reasons.
+ Add cProcess.sBasePath. This value should be reliable, if available.
+ Added cModule.sBinarypath. This value may not be available and may not be
  accurate. I am not aware of a 100% reliable way of retrieving it, so it is
  there only as a potential path. Use with caution.
+ cModule HTML report info is dynamically generated, only when needed.
+ Updated magic values to include more page-heap related values.
+ Handle cases where cdb gets confused and reports the unloading of a module in
  a process it's not debugging by ignoring this event completely.
+ Improve memory corruption detection and handling.

Bug fixes
---------
+ `cBugId.fbFinished` now returns `True` or `False`, rather than `None`.
+ Handle never before seen format of last instruction during access violation
  analysis.
+ Handle never before seen page heap output.
+ Handle never before seen TEB32 output.
+ Various minor fixes (typo-s, uninitialized variables, etc.)
+ Limit memory dump size.

2017-05-31
==========
Changes to BugIds
-----------------
+ Access violations at a magic address (e.g. NULL, Poison) now use `@` rather
  than `:`, as in `AVR@NULL`.
+ Use after frees are now likely to have block size and offset information, as
  in `UAFR[0x20]+4`. See below for details.
+ Architecture independent sizes and offset use `n` rather than `*N`, as in
  `AVR@NULL+4n`. This makes them shorter and just as easy to read.
+ Stowed exceptions are reported as `Stowed[X,Y,...]` where `X,Y,...` are the
  BugIds of the stowed exception(s).
+ "corrupted heap pointer or using wrong heap" VERIFIER STOP messages are now
  handled and reported as `IncorrectHeap[size]`, where `size` is the size of
  the relevant heap block.
+ Windows Run-Time errors are now reported as `WRTOriginate` and `WRTLanguage`,
  depending on their exact type. This is only true for non-stowed exceptions.
  However, BugId ignores the first-chance exception cause by these errors to
  allow the application to handle them. If the application does not handle
  them, they appear to always be thrown as a stowed exception next, so you may
  not actually see these in BugId, but rather the stowed exceptions they cause.
+ The code that tried to determine if a stack exhaustion was caused by a
  recursive function call appears to have been broken, yielding bad results.
  This code has been improved, so the BugIds should be different in a good way.
  Also, the way stack hashes beyond the desired maximum number are combined
  into one has been modified, which may also change BugIds for such crashes.
+ I've refined many assertion failures and added more detail to the BugId, so
  you will now see things like `Assert:Unreachable` and `Assert:Deprecated` for
  supposedly unreachable and deprecated code respectively.
+ I've hidden more functions that are used to throw exceptions, and not related
  to the bug that caused it. This should get you better stack hashes that are
  more unique to the instance of the bug, rather than the class of bug.

Changes to cBugId API and dxConfig
----------------------------------
+ `dxBugIdConfig.py` has been renamed to `dxConfig.py` and is now exposed as
  `cBugId.dxConfig`. Please use the later if you need to make changes to the
  settings on the fly from code that uses cBugId.
+ `bInternalExceptionOccured` no longer exists; code using cBugId should add a
  handler for `fInternalExceptionCallback` to track whether an internal
  exception occurs themselves.
+ `fApplicationSuspendedCallback` is now called with two arguments: the first
  is still the cBugId instance, the second argument is a string describing the
  reason why the application was suspended. This string can be used to inform
  if the reason for the application being suspended.
+ `fPageHeapNotEnabledCallback` is a new callback the is called whenever cBugId
  detects that page heap is not enabled for a particular binary. The handler
  is called with three arguments:
  `uProcessId` - the relevant process id,
  `sBinaryName` - the name of the binary for the process, for which page heap
      should be enabled.
  `bPreventable` - Set to `False` if an internal Windows error in determining
      the binary name for this process is the root cause. This means page heap
      will not be enabled in practice even if you did enable it for this binary:
      Windows is not able to determine the binary name for unknown reasons, and
      thus cannot determine if page heap should be enabled and defaults to not
      enabling it. Set to `True` if page heap is not enabled because it is 
      explicitly not enabled for this binary.
  This check must be enabled with the `bEnsurePageHeap` setting in `dxConfig`
  (see the "New features" section below for details on this setting).
  It is advised to assert if this callback is called with `bPreventable` set to
  `True`, as you should always run with page heap enabled when possible. Only
  when you explicitly cannot or do not want to enable it should you ignore this
  warning.
  If no handler is provided, cBugId will automatically assert when a process is
  running without page heap and `bPreventable` is `True`! This results in an
  internal error and the relevant callback.
+ Replace `bForcePageHeap` with `bEnsurePageHeap` in `dxConfig`, as enforcing
  it was not actually possible AFAICT. If set to True, cBugId checks if page
  heap is enabled in every process it debugs. If it is not, it calls
  `fPageHeapNotEnabledCallback` or an exception is thrown, as explained below.
  Also `uDisablePageHeapFlags` and `uEnablePageHeapFlags` are no longer used.
+ `uMaxFunctionOffset` in `dxConfig` has been replaced with
  `uMaxExportFunctionOffset`. The effect is the same, but it no only affects
  export symbols.
+ `fStdErrOutputCallback` is a new callback that is called whenever the 
  application or cdb output a line of text to stderr. The callback handler is
  called with the cBugId instance as its first argument and the line of text in
  the second. This can be used to show or store all stderr output.
+ `fNewProcessCallback` is a new callback that is called whenever a new process
  is started by the application. The callback handler is called with the cBugId
  instance as its first argument and the cProcess instance that represents the
  new process as the the second. If you plan on saving the cProcess instance
  for later use, please check that cProcess.bTerminated is not True before
  attempting to use it, as many properties are determined at the time they are
  read and this will no longer work after the process has terminated.
+ `bOutputStdOut` and `bOutputStdIn` have been replaced with `bOutputStdIO`, as
  I found it really only makes sense to show both and having them behind one
  setting makes changing it easier.
+ If no `fFailedToDebugApplicationCallback` is provided, cBugId will now assert
  when it fails to debug an application.
+ The default `uMaxStackFramesCount` value was increased from 20 to 40 and the
  default `uMaxStackRecursionLoopSize` value was increased from 50 to 100 to
  reflect increased code complexity in some of the targets I have been fuzzing.
+ `bDeleteCorruptSymbols` allows BugId to delete corrupt pdb files in an effort
  to have cdb download them again (only if a symbol server URL is provided).
  (BugId originally already did this; this setting allows you to disable it).
  

Other new features
------------------
+ Use after frees are now reported with block size and offset when this
  information is available. Page heap marks the virtual allocation inaccessible
  after the heap block has been freed, but it still contains this information.
  By making the virtual allocation (temporarily) accessible, it can be read and
  used in the BugId.
+ Links to official on-line source repositories are added to source code paths
  in the stack dump in HTML reports. This is currently implemented for Chrome,
  Firefox and the BugId tests, and it should be easy to extend this to other
  open-source projects.
+ Add debugger extension to allow BugId to change virtual allocation access
  protection in order to read inaccessible memory. This is used to read
  information from freed memory blocks marked inaccessible by page heap.
+ Add new version update and check code. You can call `cBugId.fsCheckVersion`,
  which will grab the latest version number from GitHub and check it against
  the local version. It will return a human readable string explaining if you
  are up-to-date or not.
+ Add the `fPageHeapNotEnabledCallback` argument to the cBugId constructor. It
  is called when cBugId detect page heap is not enabled for a process. If not
  set, or set to None, an assertion is raised instead when this happens. If it
  is set, BugId will continue to run after this callback. This allows you to
  ignore this problem if you need to.
+ Attempt to improve symbols in call stack by checking if there is a direct
  call instruction immediately before the return address of every stack frame.
  If there is, use the symbol being called in that instruction, rather than the
  symbol for the code currently being executed in that frame. In this case, we
  will no longer know the "offset" in the function of the code being executed,
  as we only know the symbol. However, I've never found any use for this
  offset, and the symbols retrieved this way have shown to be more useful in
  many cases.
+ Determine the name of each function on the stack by looking at the call
  instruction right before the return address. This should match the function
  name provided by cdb. If it does not, use the former, as this is more
  accurate. This is currently only implemented for direct (0xE8) calls.
+ Inline functions are marked as such in HTML reports.

Bug fixes
---------
+ The way BugId determines if a stack exception is caused by a recursive
  function call has been improved (it was effectively broken before).
+ Do not assert if the size of a dumped memory region is exactly the maximum
  size; only if it's larger.
+ Handle (==ignore) more irrelevant cdb warnings and errors.
+ No longer report suspended application each time cdb is attaching to
  additional processes beyond the first.
+ Handle (==ignore) blank first lines in event details output.
+ Make stack buffer overflow test reliable by using globals rather than (stack
  based) locals for pointer and counter. This prevents the pointer and counter
  from being modified by the overflow.
+ Make heap buffer overflow test reliable by explicitly freeing heap blocks in
  order to force detection of heap corruption.
+ STATUS_NO_MEMORY bug reports accidentally had a tuple in the bug description,
  this is now a string.
+ Find correct heap block address in VERIFIER STOP for double frees; a bug
  in verifier causes it to output a pointer to a structure that contains this
  address, rather than the address itself. The correct address will now be
  extracted from this structure.
+ Improved way of determining the binary file name for processes.
+ Various minor bug fixes.

Improvements
------------
+ Handle "corrupted header" VERIFIER STOP messages.
+ Handle cdb termination in the stdio thread by throwing a specific exception.
  This removes the need for many, many checks to see if cdb is still alive,
  making the code easier to read and maintain. It also removes the risk of a
  missing check.
+ Improved stowed exception handling. This should now work reliably, but it has
  not been tested extensively: feedback on the reports generated is welcome!
+ Better illegal instruction security impact description
+ The `fInternalExceptionCallback` argument to the cBugId constructor is now
  called with an additional arguments if an exception happens. In addition to
  the exception object, a traceback object is added, which can be used to
  construct a stack trace for the exception.
+ `cBugId.oInternalException` is replaced by `cBugId.bInternalExceptionOccured`,
  which is False by default and set to True when an exception occurs.
+ The `fMainProcessTerminatedCallback` argument to the cBugId constructor is
   now called with two additional arguments: the process id and the name of the
   binary for the process.
+ All bug translation code has been moved into the `BugTranslation` folder.
  This also contains all bug translations, grouped into separate files.
+ Object oriented handling of processes and virtual memory allocations.
+ Cache process information such as the main module and binary name, as well as
  pointer and memory page size: these values should be static for the lifetime
  of each process.
+ Cache module information such as the start address and end address as well as
  information about the binary.
+ JIT creation of Stacks. This should reduce the number of times the stack is
  collected, speeding up debugging of applications.
+ A BugReport is always generated, even if a bug is not fatal (no more `None`).
  The `sBugTypeId` can be set to `None` to indicate there is no bug.
+ `ftsGetHeapBlockAndOffsetIdAndDescription` is used everywhere, which should
  ensure heap block sizes and offsets in ids and descriptions are uniform.
+ Try to handle OOM in places where this is most likely to happen during
  construction of HTML reports by dropping as much information from the report
  as needed.
+ Use start and end markers to improve detection of errors during command
  execution and make it easier to ignore output that is not part of the
  command being executed.
+ Lincense image in HTML reports is no longer loaded from a URL on the internet,
  but included as a `data:` url.
+ The way BugId tracks which frames to hide and which frames to consider
  relevant to a bug and use in the stack hash has been improved. This
  specifically improves the BugId for recursive function calls. It also adds
  information about the reason why a function was hidden to the HTML report,
  which may be useful if you do not understand why this is happening.
+ The way BugId stores commands send to cdb and the output received from cdb
  for the HTML report has been modified to be more reliable.
+ Various improvements to inline documentation.
+ Various improvements to cdb stdio thread code.
+ Various minor improvements to code quality and readability.
+ Removed some dead code and commented out debug output code.

Changes to Tests
---------------------
+ Stack hashes are now checked as part of the tests. This should allow me to
  detect when a code change modifies stack hashes and result in more stable
  stack hashes across different versions of cBugId.
+ Changed asm code in order to always create a stack frame, which makes it
  easier for cdb to determine the correct stack frames (but it's still not
  perfect).
+ Better ISA specific numbers in tests
+ Added OOM test using HeapAlloc and C++ new operator.
+ Added FailFast test.
+ Added WRTOriginate test.
+ Added WRTLanguage test.
+ Improved recursive function call test to allow loops of various sizes.
+ Added Integer overflow test.
+ Added stdout output to all tests.
+ Moved more tests to the full test suite, to speed to quick tests.
+ Dump stack trace on exception.
+ Changed arguments of many tests for better test coverage.
+ Show time it takes to complete test.
+ No more parallel testing; it did not actually increase the speed of testing
  as I had hoped, but did seem to make results more unreliable. I suspect cdb
  uses some kind of system-wide locks that prevent multiple instance from
  running at the same time.
+ Add test for Breakpoint crash in a child process using cmd.exe as the parent.
  On x64, there are two such tests: the parent is always x64, but the child can
  be x86 and x64.

2017-03-24
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fixed sign on access violations just below the stack.

Improvements
------------
+ Better Security impact suggestion for DoubleFree.
+ Added test reports back.
+ Handle OOM while generating HTML reports better by dropping some info rather
  than crashing.

2017-01-31
==========
Improvements
------------
+ BugId now detects Double-frees correctly.

2016-12-30
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ While creating a large memory dump, a size calculation lead to a floating
  point number instead of a long. This caused an exception and has been fixed.
+ Report access violations close the the stack of the current thread as stack
  related.

Improvements
------------
+ Updated tests.

2016-12-22
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Improve chances of detecting a recursive function call rather than a stack
  exhaustion.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Add missing argument to function call in handling of AVs

2016-12-15
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Align all memory dumps and limit their sizes to prevent errors and very large
  HTML reports.
+ Don't assert if Verifier reports corruption at a higher address than the
  corrupted byte with the lowest address we can find.
+ Fix wrong variable name error.

2016-12-14
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Handle more in-line cdb symbol loading error message formats.
+ Get module version information before reading it, as the old code would read
  and use the initial `None` value before setting it to the correct value.
+ Fix a bug where excessive CPU usage detector would attempt to remove a 
  breakpoint twice.

2016-12-12
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix bug where error messages that start in the middle of a line of output
  were not detected and removed, as was claimed in previous fix on 12-09.

2016-12-11
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix bug in handling of VERIFIER STOP messages where no corruption is detected
  by BugId itself.
+ Fix bug in HTML report where blocks where not collapsible and correct
  spelling error.

2016-12-09
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Improve the way symbol loading errors are handled: they should now be handled
  correctly even if they start in the middle of a line of output.
+ Fix information extraction for VERIFIER STOP messages to get the corruption
  address correctly.

2016-12-05
==========
API changes
-----------
+ `cBugId` now exposes the `sOSISA` property, which represents the Operating
  System's Instruction Set Architecture. It will be set to either "x86" or
  "x64" according to the architecture the OS was designed for.

2016-11-30
==========
BugId changes
-------------
+ The use-after-free BugId now contains the offset from the end of the memory
  page in which the freed memory allocation was stored, at which the code
  attempted to use the freed memory. For instance, if an application attempts
  to read data at offset 4 in a freed 0x10 byte memory block, the BugId will
  now be `UAFR[]~0xC`, as the end of the memory block aligns with the end of
  the memory page and a read at offset 4 is 0xC bytes away from that end.
+ A use-after-free that is also out-of-bounds will now be reported as such
  whenever possible. For instance, if an application attempts to read data at
  offset 0x14 in a freed 0x10 byte memory block (i.e. beyond the end of the
  freed memory block), the BugId will now be `OOBUAFR[]+0x4`, as the end of the
  memory block aligns with the end of the memory page and a read at offset 0x14
  is 0x4 bytes after that end.

Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix missing variable in stack handling code.

2016-11-24
==========
API changes
-----------
+ Added `cBugId.oInternalException`, which is normally None, unless an internal
  exception has occurred. This should make handling such exceptions easier for
  wrapper functions, as they no longer need to handle internal exception
  callbacks to get a reference to the exception.
+ Added `cBugId.sFailedToDebugApplicationErrorMessage`, which is normally None,
  unless the application cannot be started or attached to, in which case it
  contains a string describing the error.
+ Changed callbacks:
  + `fFailedToDebugApplicationCallback`: called when the application cannot be
    started or attached to. Arguments: (oBugId, sErrorMessage)
  + `fApplicationRunningCallback`: called *only once* when the application is
    started or resumed after attaching. The other calls to this callback seen
    in previous versions have been replaced with calls to
    `fApplicationResumedCallback` instead.
  + `fApplicationSuspendedCallback`: called whenever the application is
    suspended because of an exception, timeout or breakpoint. Replaces the
    dubious `fApplictionExceptionCallback` seen in previous versions.
  + `fApplicationResumedCallback`: called whenever the application is resumed
    after having been suspended.
  + `fMainProcessTerminatedCallback`: called when any of the application's main
    processes terminate. Replaces `fApplicationExitCallback`.
+ You must explicitly call `cBugId.fStart()` to start debugging the
  application. This should prevent race conditions where a thread can fire a
  callback in a separate thread before the cBugId constructor is finished,
  causing it to use an incomplete instance of cBugId and triggering various
  errors.
+ All callbacks now get called with an additional first argument: oBugId, which
  is set to the relevant cBugId instance. This should make interacting with
  BugId from these callbacks easier to implement.
+ Breakpoint callbacks now get called with two arguments: `oBugId`, as
  explained above and `uBreakpointId`, which contains the id of the breakpoint
  that was hit, as returned by `fuAddBreakpoint`.

2016-11-22
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Fix UnboundLocalError in CPU usage detection that could happen when
  application terminates.
+ Fixed a bug where cdb reported a stack overflow resulted in a stack extracted
  from outside normal bounds, which caused an assertion failure.
+ Handle cdb termination while reading cdb stdout better.
+ Attempt to handle failure to send signal to cdb better.

2016-11-21
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Size of memory region dumps is now limited by the
  `dxBugIdConfig["uMaxMemoryDumpSize"]` setting. This prevents errors on really
  large memory regions, speeds up BugId and reduces report size on large memory
  regions.
+ Access violation address should now always be added to the memory dumps in
  HTML reports; previously, it was not always reported.

Bug fixes
---------
+ See the above limit to memory region dump size.
+ Fixed bug where if cdb died at a certain time during analysis, this was not
  handled correctly and BugId threw an incorrect assertion failure.
+ Fixed a bug where cdb would report a stack pointer having an unexpected value
  that caused an assertion failure.


2016-11-17
==========
Improvements
------------
+ HTML reports now start with "Stack" section open.

2016-11-16
==========
API changes
-----------
+ dxBugIdConfig is now read from `dxConfig["cBugId"]` rather than
  `dxConfig["BugId"]`.
+ Failure to start an application now results in an exception. This makes more
  sense and allows you to distinguish between an application terminating after
  running, or an application not running at all.

Improvements
------------
+ cBugId now shows you which arguments it takes exactly.
+ More Edge and Firefox assertions that trigger an int3 are detected as such.
+ Charset, CSP and MSIE X-UA-Compatible data in HTML reports for better UI.
+ Twitter card info in HTML report (in case you ever link to one in a tweet).

Bug fixes
---------
+ cdb termination while generating a cBugReport could cause an exception. This
  is now handled correctly.
+ More cdb warnings that caused assertions are ignored.

2016-11-08
==========
Some of the changes can result in different BugIds for the same crash with this
version as compared to previous versions. See below for details.

API changes
-----------
+ The `bGetDetailsHTML` argument of `cBugId` was renamed to
 `bGenerateReportHTML` to better reflect what it does and for naming
 consistency across the code.
+ `cBugId` has two new arguments: `asLocalSymbolPaths` and `asSymbolCachePaths`:
  + `asLocalSymbolPaths` should be used to provide a list of folders that
    contain locally stored symbols, such as those generated when compiling a
    binary yourself.
  + `asSymbolCachePaths` should be used to provide a list of folders in which
    symbols can be downloaded from symbol servers and is used as a cache.
    This argument replaces the `asSymbolCachePaths` setting in
    `dxBugIdConfig.py`.
+ The `asDefaultSymbolCachePaths` setting was added to `dxBugIdConfig.py`.
  This value is used if no `asSymbolCachePaths` argument is provided to `cBugId`
  or if `None` is provided. If you do not want to use any symbol cache paths,
  you should use `asSymbolCachePaths = []`.
+ The `asDefaultSymbolServerURLs` setting has been added to `dxBugIdConfig.py`.
  This value is used if no `asSymbolServerURLs` argument is provided to `cBugId`
  or if `None` is provided. If you do not want to use any symbol servers, you
  should use `asSymbolServerURLs = []`.
+ The `bMakeSureSymbolsAreLoaded` setting has been added to control whether
  symbols load errors are detected and fixed. It is disabled by default, which
  is a break from the original behavior, because this can significantly speed
  up analysis. If you are experiencing problems generating consistent reports
  and are missing symbols, you may want to re-enable this setting to see if this
  fixes the issue for you.

Improvements
------------
+ Analysis should be much faster: getting the values of register and pseudo
  registers was done in a way that triggered a symbol look-up, which is very
  slow (10 seconds or more). this is now done in a different way that avoids
  this, which should greatly improve analysis speed in many cases.
+ Detect more Control Flow Guard breakpoint exceptions.
+ The interval for CPU usage tests has been decreased to speed up these tests.

Bug fixes
---------
+ With HTML reports disabled, code that creates part of the HTML report would
  still execute while getting the stack. This code could then cause an
  exception. This code is no longer executed if not HTML report is required.
+ With HTML reports disabled, code that creates part of the HTML report for
  binary module information would still be executed. This code is no longer
  executed if not HTML report is required.
+ The code handling VERIFIER STOPs would assume page heap information would
  always be available and contain the memory block address and size, which is
  not the case (e.g. the block start address and size is not available for
  freed memory blocks. This could cause an exception. The code now handles this
  correctly.
+ Bug translation could fail if a stack frame had no symbol. This could result
  in bug being translated incorrectly, and getting the wrong type (e.g. an
  Assert could be reported as an OOM). This has been fixed.
+ Stack hashed and the crash location were not ideal when a relevant stack
  frame had no symbols. This has been fixed.

2016-10-13
==========
Breaking changes
----------------
+ Renamed sDetailsHTML property of bug report to sReportHTML (and
  sDetailsHTMLTemplate to sReportHTMLTemplate).
+ Don't count stack frames without a symbol towards the number of hashed frames.
  They are added to the hash as a placeholder (`-`), so you hash may get larger
  than what you could previously expect.

Improvements
------------
+ Replace tabs with spaces where appropriate in HTML report.
+ Add ISA to module version information.
+ Handle STATUS_WAKE_SYSTEM_DEBUGGER better.


2016-10-12
==========
Improvements
------------
+ Cleanup stack for VERIFIER STOP message by removing top stack frames that are
  irrelevant, as is already done for other bugs.


2016-10-11
==========
Bug fixes
---------
+ Add missing include in code handling unexpected cdb termination.
+ Add missing property to report for unexpected cdb termination.
+ Disable automatically applying of page heap: it was causing access violations
  for unknown reasons.


2016-10-10
==========
New features
------------
+ Page heap settings are now automatically applied by default to all processes
  to ensure best results. Settings can be used to disable this if needed. Which
  settings are applied can also be modified through settings.

Bugfixes
--------
+ cCdbWrapper_fuGetValue now ignores an additional cdb warning.


2016-10-07
==========
New or changed BugIds
---------------------
+ Detect and report misaligned frees in VERIFIER STOP heap stamp corruptions,
  the BugId takes the for `MisalignedFree[size]+offset`. e.g if the code
  attempts to free heap using a pointer that is at offset 0x8 of a 0x20 byte
  block, you will get a BugId of `MisalignedFree[0x20]+8`
+ The `FailFast2:` prefix was removed from FailFast exceptions.
+ Both `LegacyGS` and `StackCookie` FailFast exceptions are now reported as
  `OOBW[Stack]` (as in: Out-Of-Bounds Write on the Stack).

Improvements
------------
+ Mayor rewrite of page heap information handling, same code now used when an
  access violation is handled as well as for VERIFIER STOPs.
+ Rewrite of parts of the VERIFIER STOP handling code.
+ Change code to not generate information for the HTML report when this is not
  needed.
+ memory dumps in HTML reports contain more information.
+ Rewrote parts of the memory corruption detector.


2016-10-05
==========
Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Handle error output by cdb when getting value using cCdbWrapper.fuGetValue.
+ Fix typo in new FailFast code that caused exception when dumping stack.


2016-10-04
==========
New features
------------
+ Add stack dump to FailFast exceptions that report stack cookie corruption.
+ Add VERIFIER STOP message to reports.

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ New way of dumping memory regions and marking memory addresses and ranges
  with remarks.
+ Some layout changes in memory regions in HTML reports.
+ Improve sanity checks in code that detects VERIFIER STOP messages.
+ Rewrote parts of CPU usage detection code.


2016-09-13
==========
Alterations to bug report
-------------------------
+ Default security impact is no longer None but "Denial of Service".

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Reorder HTML report output and add source.
+ Fix bug where binary version information was not available when HTML report
  was not generated.


2016-09-12
==========
New features
------------
+ Output application command-line in HTML report.

Alterations to exception handling
---------------------------------
+ Ignore first chance STATUS_HANDLE_NOT_CLOSABLE exceptions, similar to how
  other handle related exceptions are handled.

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Avoids problems in timezone parsing in debugger time.
+ Make stack handling more robust.


2016-09-09
==========
Added features
--------------
+ Added `cBugReport.asVersionInformation`, which contains version information
  on the main process binary (i.e. the .exe) and the binary in which the crash
  happened if it's not the main process binary (i.e. a .dll).


2016-09-08
==========
Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Avoid some exceptions that can happen after cdb has terminated, when the code
  tries to make sure it has.
+ Report descriptive error if FileSystem or Kill are not found.
+ Handle empty arguments to the application ("")


2016-09-07
==========
Alterations to BugIds
---------------------
+ Replace "?" in BugIds with "_": this improvies legibility
  IMHO and makes use of the BugId in a file or folder name easier.

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Handle negative offsets in time zone in debugger time to prevent an exception.
+ Add another Chrome OOM crash signature
+ Improve handling of symbol problems in page heap output.


2016-09-05
==========
+ Bug fixes, no API changes.


2016-08-31
==========
Alterations to BugIds
---------------------
+ The BugId can now include the number of overwritten bytes, and a hash of
  their values if you supply a dxBugIdConfig["uHeapCorruptedBytesHashChars"]
  setting value of 1 or more. This can be useful when you want to detect if
  two instances of heap corruption wrote the same data to corrupt the heap.
  When enabled, a string with format "~L:H" is added to the BugId, where "L" is
  the length of the corruption and "H" is the hash. Note that L is not
  influenced by dxBugIdConfig["uArchitectureIndependentBugIdBits"], so BugId's
  created using this feature on x86 and x64 versions of an application may
  differ.

API changes
-----------
+ cCdbWrapper has a new first argument "sCdbISA" inserted before the existing
  arguments. This argument indicates which version of cdb to use (x86 or x64,
  default depends on the OS ISA). Using the x86 cdb to debug x86 applications
  can improve the accuracy of results over using the x64 cdb, as the later may
  not load the right symbols for ntdll, which prevents BugId from collecting
  page heap information.
+ Added dxBugIdConfig["uHeapCorruptedBytesHashChars"] (see above).

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
+ Better handling of some OOM cases
+ Better handling of failure to match symbol to address while generating
  assembly HTML
+ Better handling of some STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN cases
+ Show values of overwritten bytes in cases where heap corruption occurs.
+ cStackFrame objects now have an oPreviousFrame property, which is set to the
  frame that is lower in number (i.e. the frame that was called from this
  frame).
+ The sCdbISA argument to cCdbWrapper makes it easier to run x86 tests on x64
  OS-es, so these have been re-enabled.
+ FastFail:AppExit was not reported as a potential security issue, but since
  it can be triggered by a R6025 pure virtual function call, it can be and the
  description now reflects this.
+ The code could make excessive calls to fApplicationRunningCallback, this has
  been fixed.
