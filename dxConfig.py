  "uMaxAddressOffset": 0x1000,          # How big an offset from a special address (such as NULL) do you expect in your
                                        # application? Anything within this range from a special address is considered
                                        # to be a pointer to that address + an offset.
  "uArchitectureIndependentBugIdBits": 0, # 0 to disable or 8, 6, 32, ... to enable architecture agnostic sizes
                                        # and offsets in BugIds. For X > 0, and Y = X/8, the bug id will show numbers
                                        # that are larger than Y as "Yn+R", where R is the remainder of the number
                                        # modulo Y.
                                        # For example: when testing both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an application,
                                        # you may get different bug ids for the same access violation bug, because the
                                        # sizes and offsets depends on the architecture. However, if you set this value
                                        # to 32 (X = 32, Y = 4), the uniqueness of the offsets and sizes is reduced to
                                        # the point where you should get the same bug ids:
                                        #  0,  1,  2,  3      => "0", "1", "2", "3",

                                        # find out if this affects the corruption: if this ends up modifying the values
                                        # that are written to the heap, the BugId will change with it. It may also
                                        # result in many different BugIds for the same bug if the bytes written depend
                                        # on things not in the input that triggered the bug, e.g. timing.
  "uMaxExportFunctionOffset": 0x30,     # When using export symbols, anything but a direct hit is not reliable; the
                                        # higher an offset gets, the less reliable it is. You can choose the cut off
                                        # point using this option: any offset up to and including this number is
                                        # considered to be valid, any larger offset is not considerd valid and will
                                        # be converted into module + offset instead.
  ### Stack hash settings

                                        # bytes (only used for the "before" instructions, it's 0 for "after"). If
                                        # uDisassemblyAlignmentBytes is too small, the first instruction you see may
                                        # not be an instruction that will ever get executed, as disassembly happed in
                                        # the middle of the "real" instruction. If uDisassemblyAverageInstructionSize
                                        # is too small, you may see less instructions than requested when not enough
                                        # bytes get disassembled to get the requested number of instructions. If the
                                        # total number of bytes disassembled is too large, you may get no disassembly

  ### Symbol loading settings
  "bDeleteCorruptSymbols": True,        # Allow BugId to try to delete symbol files that cdb claims are corrupted (but
                                        # only if a symbol server URL is provided). This may allow BugId to re-download

                                        # It has a large impact on performance, so you may want to disable it by setting

  "asDefaultSymbolCachePaths": [""],    # Where should symbols be cached if no cache paths are provided? The default

  ### Source code settings
  "bEnableSourceCodeSupport": True,     # Tell cdb to load source line symbols or not.
  "dsURLTemplate_by_srSourceFilePath": {}, # Used to translate source file paths to links to online code repository.

  ### Excessive CPU usage detection

                                        # report. Value in percent of the check interval, e.g. a value of 75 for a
                                        # check interval of 10s means a bug will be reported if the application uses
                                        # the CPU more than 7.5 seconds during a 10s interval.

                                        # inaccurate. Higher values increase the time in which the code can run and
                                        # return to the topmost function. If you provide too large a value the CPU
                                        # using loop may finish, giving you invalid results.
  ### Timeouts
  "nTimeoutGranularity": 1.0,           # How often to check for timeouts, in seconds. Making this value smaller causes
                                        # the timeouts to fire closer to the intended time, but slows down debugging.
                                        # Making the value larger can cause timeouts to fire a lot later than requested.
  ### C++ exception handling
  "bIgnoreCPPExceptions": False,        # Can be used to ignore C++ exceptions completely in applications that use them
                                        # a lot. This can speed up debugging quite a bit, but you risk not detecting
                                        # unhandled C++ exceptions. These will cause the application to terminate if
                                        # this setting is enabled, so you may still be able to detect an unhandled C++
                                        # exception through unexpected application termination.
  ### HTML Report debug output settings
  "bShowAllCdbCommandsInReport": False, # Set to True to see all commands that are executed in cdb by BugId. Set to
                                        # False to let BugId determine what to show based on the

                                        # the binaries, etc. This can be useful if you are not getting enough

                                        # Set to False to see only cdb output returned while running the application

                                        # need to switch this to True. If you do; you should consider contacting the
